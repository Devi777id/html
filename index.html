        <h3>About Tacos</h3>
        <p>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is a taco?
            <br>
A taco is a Mexican dish that typically consists of a corn or wheat tortilla that is filled with meat, cheese, vegetables, and sauce. Tacos are usually served with salsa, guacamole, and sour cream on the side.


There are many different types of tacos, including beef, chicken, fish, and veggie. Fun fact, the most popular type of taco in the United States is the beef taco!


Tacos are a versatile dish. They can be eaten as a main dish or as a snack, and they are often served at celebratory parties and gatherings. Tacos are also one of the most common and popular street foods in many Mexican cities.
